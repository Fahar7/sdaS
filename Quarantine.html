  <h2>Apa itu Rainbow Quarantine</h2>
  <p class="DescQuar">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege exhibits continued success for Ubisoft, with its tactical multiplayer supported by a competition-primed sandbox, and regular free updates for almost half a decade. That's established a near 60
    million-strong following across console and PC, demonstrating an identity through personified Operators and deep-rooted gameplay synergies.<br>

    Ubisoft capitalizes on the same philosophies in Rainbow Six Quarantine, a new spin-off focused on cooperative, squad-based first-person shooter action. It takes influence from Outbreak, one of the most popular limited-time Rainbow Six Siege
    events, pitting its cast against a mysterious biohazard pandemic threatening humankind. <br>

    Rainbow Six Quarantine shares its tactical fundamentals with Rainbow Six Siege, developed by a new team under the same Montreal office. That includes shared defining signatures, including gadgets, gunplay, and destruction, but translated into a
    three-player cooperative setting with AI enemies.</p>

  <h2>Rainbow Seven Quarantine Release Date</h2>
  <p class="DescQuar">While Ubisoft unveiled Rainbow Six Quarantine with availability scheduled for 2020, it later stated the title was among three upcoming projects delayed to ensure additional development time. Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, tells investors the game now targets a release throughout its 2020 to 2021 fiscal year. That indicates Rainbow Six Quarantine will release between now and March 2021.</p>
